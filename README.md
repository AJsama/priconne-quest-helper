## Information
This is a tool to help you decide which is the best quest to farm to get
whatever assortment of items you need to rank up your characters.

I consider this project to be in BETA at the moment. The basic features 
are all implemented but I wouldn't consider this project at it's current
state to be the complete experience. Also many things may change and
break in this time.

## Recommended Procedure On How To Use This Tool
1. Open the tool URL in your phone or PC browser: (https://expugn.github.io/priconne-quest-helper/)<br>
If on a mobile phone, horizontal viewing is probably best.
2. Open up `Princess Connect Re:Dive` via your phone or DMM Game Player.
3. Decide which characters you want to rank up and select the required equipment in the tool.
4. The tool will calculate which materials and the amount you need for you; Open up your equipment box.
5. Determine which materials you need to farm more of in your box; for the materials you have enough of, click/tap the material image under the `Required Ingredients` category on the tool to `disable` them.
<br>Disabled materials will **NOT** be shown in the `Recommended Quests` category.
6. A list of quests (max 10) will be displayed under the `Recommended Quests` category.
<br>Decide for yourself which quest is the best for you and most cost efficient for your stamina.

## Quest Points?
Quest points is what determines how quests should be sorted in the `Recommended Quests` category.

| Cause | Quest Point Awarded |
| :---: | :---: |
| `Material is in the First or Second Slot`<br><br>Materials in the first or second slot tend to have higher drop rates compared to the third item. | `1.0` |
| `Material is in the Third Slot`<br><br>Materials in the third slot tend to have a lower drop rate compared to the first and second item. | `0.75` |
| `Material is in the Third Slot but Shares the Same Drop Rate as the First and Second Item`<br><br>This is the case for earlier quests (`54%` for the first three items) or hard mode quests (`72%` for the first three items). | `1.0` |
| `Material is a Sub-Drop Item`<br><br>Sub-drop items are not displayed in the quest info in-game, but they have a lower drop rate than the first three items.<br>There are a collection of five different sub-drop items in every quest with a drop rate of `20%` each. | `0.5` |

The amount of quest points awarded to the quest is displayed on the right after all the quest items are listed.

`* Quest points may end up just becoming hidden in the future.`

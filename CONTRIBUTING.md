# Contributing to priconne-quest-helper

Thanks for your interest in wanting to contribute to this project!

These guidelines will (maybe) help guide you on how you can contribute 
and make this tool a better experience for all users.

## Code of Conduct

If you wish to participate, I don't really have much expectations, just 
don't be disrespectful to others and their work and you'll be fine.

For a more strict guideline, just follow the 
[priconne-quest-helper Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Expugn/priconne-quest-helper/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## How Can I Contribute?

### Translating

If possible, I'd like `priconne-quest-helper` to support a variety of 
languages so that those who may not understand English will be able to 
use it with no issues or having to deal with a rough translation from 
an auto translation software.

Some basic guidelines about translations:
* Translations **don't have to be exact**, but they should at least 
convey the same meaning as the English version.
* If additional text is added to the system after something is 
translated, I will update the language `.json` to include the new text, 
but I will leave it in English unless it's a simple word.
    * If you wish to translate this new text, open a `Pull Request` for 
    that language `.json` and after review I will add it.
    * If you don't want to open a `Pull Request`, submitting an issue 
    with the updated language `.json` to the [`Github Issue Tracker`](https://github.com/Expugn/priconne-quest-helper/issues) 
    is fine as well.
* Those who work on translating will be credited on the footer of the 
main page and the README document.

`Princess Connect! Re:Dive` currently has three different servers: 
`Japan`, `Taiwan`, and `Korea`. If you want to contribute to any of 
these languages by translating or proofreading then you are free to.

Other languages don't have as high of a priority, but can be translated 
if desired.

**Here's what I'm interested in being translated:**
* Main Page <https://expugn.github.io/priconne-quest-helper/>
* Wiki <https://github.com/Expugn/priconne-quest-helper/wiki>

### Incorrect Quest/Recipe/Character Data

I don't exactly have a tool at the moment where I can compile all this 
data automatically, so it may be quite frequent where I may add some 
incorrect data by accident.

**Examples of Incorrect Quest/Recipe/Character Data**
* A specific quest displays a full item instead of the fragment.
* A specific quest displays a different item instead.
* The recipe for an item has incorrect components.
* A character has the incorrect items for their rank up.

If any incorrect data is found, please report it to the 
[`Github Issue Tracker`](https://github.com/Expugn/priconne-quest-helper/issues) 
or open a `Pull Request` with the corrected data `.json` file.

### Bug Reports

I do try to test all features extensively when something is added, but 
there might be a few issues that fall through the cracks, like something 
browser related.

**Examples of Bugs**:
* Page fails to load for some reason.
* Setting does not update properly.
* Something does not work as expected.

If a bug is found, please report it to the 
[`Github Issue Tracker`](https://github.com/Expugn/priconne-quest-helper/issues) 
or open a `Pull Request` with the corrected bug.

### Feature Requests

I'd love to hear your suggestions! If you have an idea that will improve 
the quality of life when using this tool, then I'd love to hear it.

If you have such a suggestion, please report it to the 
[`Github Issue Tracker`](https://github.com/Expugn/priconne-quest-helper/issues) 

### Performance Improvements

One of the main complaints I hear about this tool is how slow it is to 
load. While I don't seem to have this issue myself, I'd like to know of 
any way to improve page loading speed or any other enhancement that 
might be good to use.

If you have an idea on how to improve performance, please report it to 
the [`Github Issue Tracker`](https://github.com/Expugn/priconne-quest-helper/issues) 
or open a `Pull Request` with the enhancement.
